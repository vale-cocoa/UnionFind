/// A data structure for modeling dynamic connectivity on a set of distinct elments.
///
/// Dynamic connectivity can be defined by two operations on  a set of *n* distinctive
/// nodes:
/// - **Union Command**: connect two nodes.
/// - **Find/Connected Query**: is there a path connecting two nodes?
/// Assuming *"is connected to"* is an equivalence relation between nodes, that is:
/// - **Reflexive**: *p* is connected to *p*.
/// - **Symmetric**: if *p* is connected to *q*, then *q* is also connected to *p*.
/// - **Transitive**:    if *p* is connected to *q* and *q* is connected to *r*,
///                 then *p* is also connected to *r*.
/// Where *p*, *q*, *r* are distinct nodes from the set.
